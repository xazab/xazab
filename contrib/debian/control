Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Xazab is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Xazab uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Xazab Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, xazabd, and the CLI tool
 xazab-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Xazab is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Xazab uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Xazab Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides xazab-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a xazab daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
